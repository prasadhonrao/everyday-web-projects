## **Guidelines for New Projects**
When adding a new project, please follow these guidelines:
1. **Folder Structure**: 
   - Each project should have its own folder with the following structure:
     ```
     root/
     â”œâ”€â”€ project-name/
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ src/               # Source code (HTML, CSS, JS files)
     â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ assets/            # Optional: Images, fonts, etc.
     â”‚   â””â”€â”€ README.md          # Documentation for the project
     ```
2. **Documentation**:
   - Every project must include a `README.md` with:
     - Project name
     - Brief description
     - How to run the project
     - Key features
     - Screenshots (if applicable)
3. **Code Quality**:
   - Use semantic HTML, organized CSS, and clean, readable JavaScript.
   - Avoid unnecessary dependencies unless they add significant value.
4. **Responsiveness**:
   - Make sure the project is responsive and works well on different devices and screen sizes.
